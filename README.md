## Source Code from each version
Click on branch main, and then switch to the mc version you want the source code of

## What does this mod do?
This simple mod makes it possible to mine ores like in versions before 1.17 again. That means that ores drop ores again and not raw ores.

## But whyy??
My friends and me noticed after playing the newer versions of Minecraft that the new ore logic is a bit overpowered and makes it much easier to get resources (especially Copper Ore)

## More Minecraft Versions??
I will support more Minecraft versions if it is requested. So if someone comments or opens an issue on GitHub that they want another version of Minecraft for this mod, I will make it!
